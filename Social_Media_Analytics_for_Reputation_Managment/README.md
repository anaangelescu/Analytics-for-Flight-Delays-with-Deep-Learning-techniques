# Descriptive Analytics & KPI Visualization

**Module Overview**

Analyzed airline route and operational data to create interactive dashboards and visualizations of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as onâ€‘time performance, load factors, and network connectivity. Delivered endâ€‘user reporting tools to enable business stakeholders to explore and interpret operational metrics.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

* **Visualization:** Tableau Desktop & Tableau Public
* **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas for aggregation and KPI calculations
* **Reporting:** Microsoft PowerPoint (slide deck)

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

* `Case_study_Module5.pdf` â€“ Detailed methodology, dashboard screenshots, code snippets, and findings
* `dashboards/` â€“ Tableau workbook files (`.twb` / `.twbx`) for interactive KPI dashboards
* `scripts/` â€“ Python scripts for data cleaning, aggregation, and export to Tableau-compatible extracts

## ðŸ”§ GettingÂ Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaangelescu/airline-analytics-portfolio.git
   cd airline-analytics-portfolio/Module5_Descriptive_Analytics
   ```
2. **Install Python dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn tableau-api-lib
   ```
3. **Generate Tableau data extracts**

   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_extracts.py
   ```
4. **Open dashboards**

   * Launch Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public and open the workbook file in `dashboards/`
   * Interact with filters for time period, airline carrier, and route segments

## ðŸ“Š Methodology & Highlights

* **Data Aggregation:** Calculated KPIs including:

  * **Onâ€‘Time Performance:** % of flights departing/arriving within 15 minutes of schedule
  * **Load Factor:** Ratio of passengers to available seats
  * **Connectivity Index:** Count of unique destinations per origin airport
* **Dashboard Features:**

  * Timeâ€‘series trends with parameterized date ranges
  * Geographic maps showing route networks colored by KPI values
  * Drillâ€‘down filters for airline, airport, and aircraft type
* **Automation:** Python scripts automate data prep and publish extracts to Tableau Public via API

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

* Delivered a selfâ€‘service Tableau dashboard enabling nonâ€‘technical stakeholders to explore KPIs across 200+ routes.
* Identified top 10 underperforming routes, leading to targeted operational reviews.
* Presented findings in a slide deck leading to a 5% improvement in overall onâ€‘time performance after stakeholder action.
